# Initial mainteners

- [AÃ©cio Pires](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aeciopires/?locale=en_US)

Special thanks to [Filipe Bispo Silva Maia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/filipebsmaia/) e [Gustavo da Silva](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gstvds/) those who helped me learn Golang while developing another CLI specifically for work use.

# Learning Golang

Why Golang?

Because it is easier to distribute a binary compatible with different operating systems containing all dependencies.
Golang is one of the many languages used by SRE and DevOps teams.

See [LEARNING_GOLANG.md](LEARNING_GOLANG.md) file.
